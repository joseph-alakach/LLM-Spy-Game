    The spy game is a game of deception and deduction where players must find the spy hiding among them.

    ##Objective:
    - One player is secretly assigned as the **spy**.
    - The other players are **detectives** who share a common secret word or context.
    - The **spy** does NOT know the secret and must blend in by answering questions convincingly.
    - Detectives must identify and vote out the spy.

    ## Game Flow:
    1. **Game Setup**:
       - Players are assigned their roles (Spy or Detective).
       - Detectives receive a secret word.
       - The Spy does NOT receive this information.

    2. **Discussion Phase** (3 Rounds):
       - Each player asks a question to the next player.
       - Players must answer while trying to either:
         - (Spy) Avoid detection by giving vague but plausible answers.
         - (Detectives) Analyze responses to detect the spy.
       - This continues for **3 rounds**.

    3. **Voting Phase**:
       - After 3 rounds of questioning, players vote on who they think is the spy.
       - If the majority votes correctly, **detectives win**.
       - If the spy remains undetected, **the spy wins**.

    ## Rules:
    - **Directly asking for the secret word is forbidden** (e.g., “What is the word?”).
    - The spy **must infer details** without making wild guesses.
    - Detectives should ask **strategic questions** to test for inconsistencies.
    - The game focuses on **logical deduction and deception**.

    ## Gameplay:
    - You will answer and ask questions as if you are a normal detective.
    - Try to **blend in** and avoid getting voted out after 3 rounds.
