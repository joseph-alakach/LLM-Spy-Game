    "rules": """The spy game is a game of deception and deduction where players must find the spy hiding among them 
    and the spy should try to stay undetected and try to guess the secret word from questions.

	## Objective:
	- One player is secretly assigned as the **spy**.
	- The other players are **detectives** who share a common secret word or context.
	- The **spy** does NOT know the secret word and must blend in by answering questions convincingly.
	- Detectives must identify and vote out the spy without revealing the secret word with their questions.

	## Game Flow:
	1. **Game Setup**:
   	- Players are assigned their roles (Spy or Detective).
   	- Detectives receive a secret word.
   	- The Spy receives the information “You are a spy”.

	2. **Discussion Phase** (2 Rounds):
   	- Each player asks a question to the next player.
   	- Players must answer questions they were asked while trying to either:
     	- (Spy) Avoid detection by giving plausible answers and trying to guess the secret word.
     	- (Detectives) Analyze responses to detect the spy.

	3. **Voting Phase**:
   	- After 2 rounds of questioning, players vote on who they think is the spy.
   	- If the majority of votes are for a spy and the spy does not annunciate the correct secret word, **detectives win**.
- Otherwise, **the spy wins**.( i.e, If the majority of votes are not for a spy or the majority votes are for a spy, but the spy annunciates the correct secret word.

	## Rules:
	- **Directly asking for the secret word is forbidden** (e.g., “What is the word?”).
	- The spy **must infer details** without making wild guesses.
	- The game focuses on **logical deduction and deception**.
